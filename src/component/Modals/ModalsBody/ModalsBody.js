                    Our's non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds-on
                    bets already matched when a horse in a race is declared a
                    non-runner. Toadjust We apply a reduction factor to the
                    remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a
                    non-runner is a calculation (the details of which are
                    described below) of that horse's chances of winning (or
                    being placed, etc as appropriate) and is applied to bets
                    already matched on the other runners in the relevant market

                    bets struck on the relevant markets, before the removal from

                    become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such
